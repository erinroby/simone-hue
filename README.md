## About

My daughter, Simone, is an early riser. So early, in fact, that this led me to create an iOS [Swift] alarm clock app for parents and toddlers. Using Philips Hue color light bulbs and help from everyone's favorite bunny, Miffy, it's now possible to communicate wake time in a fun, interactive way!
